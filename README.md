## What is Vibe Check?

Vibe Check is a metacognitive layer that keeps AI coding agents honest. It
pauses the agent at key moments, challenges shaky assumptions and records what
worked (or failed) so the next run is smarter. Think of it as the agent's inner
rubber duck‚Äîalways nudging the conversation back to the user's actual needs.

**TL;DR**: Vibe Check makes AI coding agents more resilient and aligned by
enforcing moments of reflection.

## The Problem: Pattern Inertia

LLMs often follow the first solution they imagine. Once that pattern takes hold
they elaborate on it even if it drifts from the original goal. Without an
external nudge the agent seldom questions its direction, leading to
misalignment, overengineering and wasted cycles.

## Key Features

- **vibe_check** ‚Äì A metacognitive tool that asks probing questions to challenge an AI agent's plan, helping it spot assumptions and stay aligned with the user's goal.
- **vibe_learn** ‚Äì An optional tool for logging mistakes, preferences, and successes. This helps track the agent's behavior over time, allowing for manual analysis and improvement.
- **Large context awareness** ‚Äì The system can be configured to use a summary of the learning log in its prompts, allowing it to spot recurring patterns and reinforce successful approaches.



## Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/PV-Bhat/vibe-check-mcp-server.git
cd vibe-check-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

This project targets Node **20+**. If you see a TypeScript error about a
duplicate `require` declaration when building with Node 20.19.3, ensure your
dependencies are up to date (`npm install`) or use the Docker setup below which
handles the build automatically.

Create a `.env` file with your API key:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for instructions on how to run tests.

### Docker

The repository includes a helper script for one-command setup. It builds the
image, saves your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and configures the container to start
automatically whenever you log in:

```bash
bash scripts/docker-setup.sh
```

This script:

- Creates `~/vibe-check-mcp` for persistent data
- Builds the Docker image and sets up `docker-compose.yml`
- Prompts for your API key and writes `~/vibe-check-mcp/.env`
- Installs a systemd service (Linux) or LaunchAgent (macOS) so the container
  starts at login
- Generates `vibe-check-tcp-wrapper.sh` which proxies Cursor IDE to the server

After running it, open Cursor IDE ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **MCP** and add a new server
of type **Command** pointing to:

```bash
~/vibe-check-mcp/vibe-check-tcp-wrapper.sh
```

See [Automatic Docker Setup](./docs/docker-automation.md) for full details.

If you prefer to run the commands manually:

```bash
docker build -t vibe-check-mcp .
docker run -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key -p 3000:3000 vibe-check-mcp
```

### Integrating with Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
"vibe-check": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/path/to/vibe-check-mcp/build/index.js"],
  "env": { "GEMINI_API_KEY": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" }
}
```

## Agent Prompting Essentials

In your agent's system prompt, make it clear that `vibe_check` is a mandatory tool for reflection. Always pass the full user request and other relevant context. After correcting a mistake, you can optionally log it with `vibe_learn` to build a history for future analysis.

Example snippet:

```
As an autonomous agent you will:
1. Call vibe_check after planning and before major actions.
2. Provide the full user request and your current plan.
3. Optionally, record resolved issues with vibe_learn.
```
