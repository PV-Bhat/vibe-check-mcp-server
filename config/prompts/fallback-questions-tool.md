# Fallback Questions (Tool Error Response)

I can see you're thinking through your approach, which shows thoughtfulness:

1. Does this plan directly address what the user requested, or might it be solving a different problem?
2. Is there a simpler approach that would meet the user's needs?
3. What unstated assumptions might be limiting the thinking here?
4. How does this align with the user's original intent?
