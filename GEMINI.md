You are continuing work on the Vibe Check MCP server repo (post-Phase 4: schemas updated to goal/plan/etc., history in state.ts, multi-provider in llm.ts, meta-mentor prompt implemented). This phase simplifies by deprecating/reducing reliance on vibe_learn (make it optional, don't feed into every vibe_check), removing any leftover pattern code (e.g., in llm.ts prompts or outputs), and ensuring focus on mentor methodology without forced interrupts.

Current code (updated excerpts—ensure matches):

src/index.ts (tools listing excerpt):
// vibe_learn schema as-is, but we'll deprecate feeding to vibe_check

src/tools/vibeLearn.ts (excerpt):
// Logs patterns, but currently feeds to learningContextText in llm.ts

src/utils/llm.ts (prompt excerpt):
// Now has your meta-mentor systemPrompt; context builds with history/goal/plan/etc.
// Remove any old patternAlert extraction

src/tools/vibeCheck.ts (output excerpt):
interface VibeCheckOutput { questions: string; } // Already simplified, no patternAlert

Steps to implement:
1. Deprecate vibe_learn Integration: In llm.ts generateResponse, remove any automatic inclusion of learningContextText or mistakeHistory (from storage.ts)—make optional via config/env (e.g., add USE_LEARNING_HISTORY=false in .env.example). Keep vibe_learn tool for manual use, but don't auto-feed to vibe_check prompts.
2. Clean Leftover Patterns: Search/remove any "pattern" references in prompts/outputs (e.g., in llm.ts fullPrompt, fallbackQuestions in vibeCheck.ts). Ensure meta-mentor prompt handles patterns humbly if spotted (as per your design—no forcing).
3. Simplify Storage/Utils: In storage.ts, add deprecation note for mistake categories if USE_LEARNING_HISTORY=false. No other changes needed.
4. Update Docs: In docs/technical-reference.md and README.md, note vibe_learn is now optional for self-improvement, emphasizing mentor focus.
5. Test: Use alt-test.js—make vibe_check call without/with vibe_learn; verify no pattern forcing in outputs, history works independently.
6. Commit: 'git commit -m "Phase 5: Simplifications - Deprecated pattern reliance, focused on mentor methodology"'.
After, explain: Files changed? Diffs? Testing results? Issues? How does this refine the mentor system (e.g., less rigid, more fluid)?
