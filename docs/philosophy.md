# Philosophy

Vibe Check started as a simple pattern interrupt. Over time it has grown into a gentler "meta‑mentor" that helps agents debug their own reasoning. The goal is not to dictate solutions but to encourage deliberate, methodology‑driven thinking.

Large models often push ahead with the first approach that comes to mind. Vibe Check slows things down with questions like "Is there a simpler path?" or "Does this still serve the user's goal?" This reflective moment keeps agents from over‑engineering or drifting off target.

The system mixes a supportive tone with honest critique. It doesn't shame mistakes; it highlights them so the agent can course‑correct. History and optional learning logs let Vibe Check spot recurring patterns and offer more contextual advice over time.

Treat Vibe Check as a collaborative partner. It's there to make the agent's process transparent and resilient, not to impose a fixed style.
