# Contributing to Vibe Check MCP

First off, thanks for considering contributing to Vibe Check! It's people like you that help make this metacognitive oversight layer even better.

## The Vibe of Contributing

Contributing to Vibe Check isn't just about codeâ€”it's about joining a community that's trying to make AI agents a bit more self-aware (since they're not quite there yet on their own).

### The Basic Flow

1. **Find something to improve**: Did your agent recently go off the rails in a way Vibe Check could have prevented? Found a bug? Have an idea for a new feature? That's a great starting point.

2. **Fork & clone**: The standard GitHub dance. Fork the repo, clone it locally, and create a branch for your changes.

3. **Make your changes**: Whether it's code, documentation, or just fixing a typo, all contributions are welcome.

4. **Test your changes**: Make sure everything still works as expected.

5. **Submit a PR**: Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request. We'll review it as soon as we can.

## Vibe Check Your Contributions

Before submitting a PR, run your own mental vibe check on your changes:

- Does this align with the metacognitive purpose of Vibe Check?
- Is this addressing a real problem that AI agents face?
- Does this maintain the balance between developer-friendly vibes and serious AI alignment principles?

## What We're Looking For

### Code Contributions

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- New features that align with the project's purpose
- Improvements to the metacognitive questioning system

### Documentation Contributions

- Clarifications to existing documentation
- New examples of how to use Vibe Check effectively
- Case studies of how Vibe Check has helped your agent workflows
- Tutorials for integration with different systems

### Pattern Contributions

- New categories for the `vibe_learn` system
- Common error patterns you've observed in AI agent workflows
- Metacognitive questions that effectively break pattern inertia

## Coding Style

- TypeScript with clear typing
- Descriptive variable names
- Comments that explain the "why," not just the "what"
- Tests for new functionality

## The Review Process

Once you submit a PR, here's what happens:

1. A maintainer will review your submission
2. They might suggest some changes or improvements
3. Once everything looks good, they'll merge your PR
4. Your contribution becomes part of Vibe Check!

## Share Your Vibe Stories
